## DESCRIPTION: 
Snack game is a game where the player controls a snack that grows in length as it consumes food. Our snack game consists of a grid of size ------ , Food appear randomly within the grid. The Snack moves continuosly in the current direction, and the player can change its direction using keyboard input such as W/A/S/D. Eating food increases the snack's length by one cell, and the score increments accordingly. The game ends when the snack collides with itself or the game boundries.We also have the feature of increase in speed of snake by 30% of its initial speed on increament of score by 10 units. When the game is over, the final score displayed in the terminal.


The project utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, where classes and objects represent elements like the snack, food and gameboard. The snack's body is managed using a vector, whilethe game grid is represented using a multi-dimensional array. The implementation relies on loops, conditionals, functions.
